    # Manual Bumping: Any commit message that includes #major, #minor, or #patch will trigger the respective version bump. If two or more are present, the highest-ranking one will take precedence.

    # Automatic Bumping: If no #major, #minor or #patch tag is contained in the commit messages, it will bump whichever DEFAULT_BUMP is set to (which is minor by default).
